# Number-Guessing-game-Python
I created a number guessing game using python.

## Steps taken:
* import random module
* choose the random computer guess
* Set number of attempts for easy and hard mode
* create a global condition for end of game
* define a function to check the difficulty
* ask the player to choose a difficulty
* Define a function to check the number of attempts left
* create function for gameplay
* define a function for the whole game itself
* call the game function.
